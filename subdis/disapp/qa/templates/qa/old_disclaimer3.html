<tab>Disapp is a phone based app that can give you an idea of the risk of catching dengue while at home,

based on your answers to the 5 questions you will be asked at the beginning. Disapp will also give you

some practical suggestions of how to bring down your risk for catching dengue while you are at home.

Right now we are in the process of testing the app with a small number of volunteer users like yourself

so we an see how the app is working in “real” conditions. We also very much want to get your

suggestions and feedback on every aspect of Disapp. So, please fill out the feedback form at the end so

we can make Disapp even better for everyone! Thank you for helping us improve Disapp!</p></tab>
